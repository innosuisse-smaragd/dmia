## Build the project
We use maven to build the application, so you will need to install it before being able to build it.

Here are the commands you need to run in order to build the project.

Build the application from the project root
```
mvn clean install
```

After the command executed, the app 'dmia-X-X-X-SHAPSHOT.war' is built and can be found in the target/ folder.

## Deploy to Tomcat (local)
As requested, the app needs to be deployed on a tomcat server. To do so, follow these steps:

### Deploy from the command line
Before deploying, set the tags </home> of the pom.xml with the absolute path to your local tomcat installation.

```
mvn cargo:deploy
```

### Deploy manually
From you file explorer, navigate to the target folder and copy the 'dmia-X-X-X-SHAPSHOT.war' file.

Paste it at the root of the tomcat/webapps folder.

The app is deployed on tomcat and can be accessed by navigating to your_tomcat_host/dmia. For example if the tomcat server runs on localhost:8080, the app is accessible at localhost:8080/dmia

## Docker
Docker can be used to containerize the frontend application so you will need to install it before being able to build it. A guide on how to so can be found at https://www.docker.com/get-started/

Here are the commands you need to run in order to build the project.

From the project root, navigate to the frontend app
```
cd src/main/js
```

Once you navigated to the root of the frontend app, execute this command:
```
docker build -t dmia-frontend .
```
After the command executed, the app is built. In order to verify that the app exists, you can run the following command:
```
docker images
```
If the build process succeeded, an image with the name dmia-frontend appears in the list of repositories.
