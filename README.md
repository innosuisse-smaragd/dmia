## Build the project
We use docker to containerize the application so you will need to install it before being able to build it. A guide on how to so can be found at https://www.docker.com/get-started/

Here are the commands you need to run in order to build the project.

From the project root, navigate to the frontend app
```
cd apps/frontend
```

Once you navigated to the root of the frontend app, execute this command:
```
docker build -t dmia-frontend .
```
After the command executed, the app is built. In order to verify that the app exists, you can run the following command:
```
docker images
```
If the build process succeeded, an image with the name dmia-frontend appears in the list of repositories.

## Deploy to Tomcat
As requested, the app needs to be deployed on a tomcat server. To do so, follow these steps:

From the project root, navigate to the frontend app
```
cd apps/frontend
```

Once you navigated to the root of the frontend app, execute this command:
```
npm run build
```

After the command executed, the app is built and can be found in the apps/frontend/dist folder.

Copy the dist folder and paste it in the tomcat webapps folder. Rename the dist folder dmia.

The app is deployed on tomcat and can be accessed by navigating to your_tomcat_host/dmia. For example if the tomcat server runs on localhost:8080, the app is accessible at localhost:8080/dmia
