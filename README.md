## Build the project
We use maven to build the application, so you will need to install it before being able to build it.

Here are the commands you need to run in order to build the project.

Build the application from the project root
```
mvn clean install
```

After the command executed, the app 'dmia-X-X-X-SHAPSHOT.war' is built and can be found in the target/ folder.

## Deploy to Tomcat
As requested, the app needs to be deployed on a tomcat server. To do so, follow these steps:

Copy the war file and paste it in the tomcat webapps/dmia folder.

The app is deployed on tomcat and can be accessed by navigating to your_tomcat_host/dmia. For example if the tomcat server runs on localhost:8080, the app is accessible at localhost:8080/dmia
